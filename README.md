This Power BI case study demonstrates how **Edit Interactions** helps control how visuals respond to slicers and cross-filtering.  
The report uses FY2019 budget and expenditure data to explore **where overspending happens**, and how users can drill down from an overview into detailed line items without confusing interactions.
